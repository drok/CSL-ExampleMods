## Example Harmony Mods

This repo demonstrates various kinds of mods, and makes a good starting point for new mods:

To start a mod, pick the closest matching example, and clone **the appropriate branch**

Eg. `git clone -b ExampleGameMod drok/Harmony-Examples MyGameMod`

This will clone the ExampleGameMod branch into a new directory named MyGameMod.
All you need to do is start adding your logic.

Note all the examples in this repo are public domain, which allows you to add any COPYING
licence you wish, and you need not give any credit to the author, nor reproduce any
copyright notices. Do with it as you please.
